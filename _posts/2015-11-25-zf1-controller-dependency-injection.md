Well, I finally did it. Some fifteen years after I wrote my first lines of code, I've finally decided to make a personal blog. GOLD STAR FOR ME! I have high hopes for keeping active with blog posts describing my adventures in the wonderful world of programming, automotive things, and whatever else I decide to ramble on about. I've decided to use the popular <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> as my blogging platform, I'm diggin' it so far. Anyhow, stay tuned, as this will <i>surely</i> be an exciting blog. Surely ;)

Here is some code to test syntax highlighting, I hope it looks good!
{% highlight php %}
<?php
class Speaker {
    public function sayHello(){
        echo "Hello World!";
    }
}
?>
{% endhighlight %}

First post done, that wasn't so bad!
