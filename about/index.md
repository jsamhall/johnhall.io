John Hall was born and raised in Bath, Maine in 1988 and moved to Burlington, Vermont to attend Champlain College. John graduated in 2010 with a degree in Computer Networking and Information Security, with a focus on Linux Server Administration. While at Champlain, John along with a team of other CNIS students participated in the annual <a href="http://www.nationalccdc.org/" target="_blank">National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition</a>, earning 3rd place out of 11 participating teams-- a record for Champlain. 

John does not enjoy referring to himself in the third person.
 
 John is currently employed as the Chief Technology Officer at <a href="https://www.bagriders.com/" target="_blank">Bag Riders Air Ride</a>, an online retailer and worldwide leader of air suspension systems. John is responsible for maintaining and upgrading the network and servers that power the company's headquarters in South Burlington VT, as well as overseeing and directing all technological advancements for the company. On a day to day basis when there is no server or network work to be done, John can be found writing code for the company websites or developing new features for internal applications.
 
 If you would like to get in touch with John for professional reasons, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:john@johnhall.io">john at johnhall dot io</a>.
 
 In his free time, John enjoys spending time with his beloved partner Ashley and taking in the beautiful sights that Vermont has to offer. If not at work or with Ashley, John is almost certainly tinkering with his heavily (over) modified Subaru WRX Wagon. If you want to see a bunch of photos of said WRX, you should follow John on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/john_br" target="_blank">Instragram at @john_br</a>.
